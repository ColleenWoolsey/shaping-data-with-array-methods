BOOK FOUR - CHAPTER 4 - SHAPING DATA WITH ARRAY METHODS
(find forEach map filter reduce)

Copy the code below into the JavaScript file, and follow the instructions in the comments.

const planets = ["mercury", "venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus", "neptune"]

1. Use the forEach method to add the name of each planet
    to a section element in your HTML with an id of "planets".
    Use string templates to construct the DOM elements.

2. Use the map method to create a new array where the
    first letter of each planet is capitalized. Use the
    `toUpperCase()` method on strings.

3. Use the filter method to create a new array that
    contains planets with the letter 'e'. Use the `includes()`
    method on strings.

4. Use the reduce method to create a sentence from the words in the following array     const words = ["The", "early", "bird", "might", "get", "the", "worm", "but", "the", "second", "mouse", "gets", "the", "cheese"]
